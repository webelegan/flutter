Avoiding Issues with Provider Package
In the next lecture, we'll use a new type of provider - at the moment, it seems to be broken (or there was an undocumented change) though.

So if you're facing any issues with the code 

Simply change

provider: ^3.0.0
in the pubspec.yaml file

to just

provider: 3.0.0
and re-run flutter packages get (if it doesn't run automatically).

NO disadvantages will occur because of that, no worries.
